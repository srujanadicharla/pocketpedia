		<h3>Causes of Burns</h3>
	<DIV CLASS="text">Burn is an injury caused to the skin surface, when it
        is exposed to a source of heat and electricity. Burns vary according to
        the tissues affected, the severity of harm caused and the resultant
        complications. Muscle, bone, blood vessel and epidermal tissue can all
        be damaged during burns. There are three main degrees of burn - first
        degree, which hampers the outer layer of the skin i.e. skin surface,
        second degree, which causes harm to the layers beneath the top skin, and
        third degree, which affects all the layers of the skin. Apart from
        causing physical harm, burns also affect a person emotionally and
        psychologically. Know more about the causes and symptoms of burns.<BR>

	<h3>Home Remedy For Burns</h3>
	<UL>
          <LI>The immediate remedy for burns would be to apply ice on the
            affected area. You can also dip the affected body part in chilled
            water, for about 15 to 20 minutes.</LI>
          <LI>The most popular and effective way to cure burns is to apply
            honey on the affected area and cover it with a bandage. </LI>
          <LI>Yogurt also acts efficiently in treating burns. Apply a generous
            amount of yogurt on the burn and keep it for about 15 minutes,
            before rinsing off. It would cool down the burnt area and provide
            relief. </LI>
          <LI>In case you have burnt the tip of your finger, tightly grip your
            ear lob. It might sound funny, but you would feel no pain at al.
          </LI>
          <LI>One of the effectual treatments of burns would be to cut a piece
            of onion and keep it over the burnt area. It would provide instant
            relief. </LI>
          <LI>Immerse the burnt portion in a bowl of whole milk for about 15-20
            minutes. It would provide relief and cure the burn. </LI>
          <LI>Egg whites also prove beneficial in curing or treating burns.
            Beat the egg white lightly and apply on the affected area.</LI>
          <LI>You can also apply diluted vinegar on the burn. It would be very
            effective in healing the burns. </LI>
          <LI>Lavender oil also is helpful in treating burns. Dab the affected
            area with lavender oil. If the burn is severe, apply the oil 3-4
            times in a day. </LI>
          <LI>Aloe Vera also treats burns effectively. Cut some fresh aloe Vera
            leaves and place them on the burnt area. </LI>
          <LI>After the burn gets healed, break a capsule of vitamin E and pour
            the liquid on the affected area. It would prevent formation of a
            scar. </LI>
          <LI>It might sound amusing, but applying some dish washing detergent
            on the burnt area helps ease the pain. </LI>
          <LI>Apply the papaya pulp on the affected area. The enzymes present
            in it would heal the wound and help remove dead cells as well.</LI>

            ice. It works wonders, treating the ailment effectively.</LI>
          <LI>Enhance the consumption of water. Larger quantity of water intake
            helps keep the mouth moist. </LI>
          <LI>Increase the consumption of food rich in Vitamin B, such as
            potatoes, bananas, lentils, chile peppers, tempeh, liver oil, liver,
            turkey, tuna, nutritional yeast (or brewer's yeast) and molasses.</LI>
          <LI>Apply glycerin on the tongue. It would give a cooling sensation,
            thereby relieving the pain and burning sensation. </LI>
          <LI>Another effective treatment for curing burning tongue is to have
            honey with milk. It increases the blood flow to the tongue, thereby
            healing it. </LI>

            This would act beneficial in treating burning tongue. </LI>

            cure burning tongue, but also promotes blood circulation. Apply
            lavender oil on the affected area and leave overnight. </LI>
          <LI>Add iron rich food, such as broccoli, spinach and parsley, to
            your diet. They will help in treating burning tongue, by aiding the
            production of new red blood cells, replacing the damaged ones. </LI>
          <LI>It is recommended to have fresh fruit juice and vegetable juice,
            while suffering from burning tongue. These juices provide the
            necessary nutrients to the body and help relieve the burning

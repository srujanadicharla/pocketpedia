		<h3>Home Remedies for Anaemia </h3>
		<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
		<LI>A proper, well-balanced diet is very beneficial for anemic
            people. Their diet should constitute of cereals, rice, pastas, dairy
            products (milk, yogurt and cheese), dry beans, eggs, vegetables and
            fruits, meat, poultry, fish and nuts. </LI>
          <LI>Foods rich in iron are also effective in curing anemia. Liver,
            green leafy vegetable, beets, dried fruits, bran flake, oysters,
            brown rice, lentils molasses, raisins and prunes have high iron
            content. Breads and pastas made from whole grain flour are also high
            in iron. Try to include all these food items in your diet.</LI>
          <LI>Food items cooked in iron pots get increased iron content. Thus,
            cooking food in iron pots can prove to be effective in curing
            anemia. </LI>
          <LI>The term 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away' is suitable in
            case of anemia. Try to consume 2 to 3 apples on a daily basis. They
            have rich iron content and thus, are helpful in treating anemia.
          </LI>
          <LI>While anemic people are recommended to have food rich in iron
            content, Vitamin C is required for the absorption of iron. Try to
            include lots of citrus fruits in your diet, such as orange, lemon,
            etc.</LI>
          <LI>Vitamin B12 is very helpful in curing anemia. Animal protein and
            organic meats, like kidney and liver, are considered to be good
            sources of this vitamin. Consuming them will prove to be beneficial
            for those suffering from anemia.</LI>
          <LI>Consumption of beetroot, as a cooked vegetable or in salad, is
            one of the best home remedies for anemia. You can also consume
            beetroot juice for the purpose.</LI>
          <LI>Sun bath is also recommended for anemic people, as it increases
            the production of red blood cells. </LI>
          <LI>Anemia can be cured by eating about 1/2 to 1 tsp. of the tincture
            of Yellow dock root, thrice in a day. You can also go for 1/2 to 1
            tsp of extract of dandelion leaf and/or root, twice a day. </LI>
          <LI>Consumption of a ripe banana; mashed and mixed with a tablespoon
            of honey, will prove to be beneficial in treating anemia. </LI>
          <LI>Apple and tomato juice have been found to be beneficial in
            treating anemia. Consume a glass of each, at least once in a day.</LI>
          <LI>Soak about 7 almonds, in water, overnight. Throw away the water
            in the morning, peel off the skin of almonds and grind them, to form
            a paste. Have this paste in the morning, for at least three months.
          </LI>
          <LI>Anemic can benefit from a combination of apple cider vinegar and
            blackstrap molasses. Combine 2 tsp of apple cider vinegar and 2 tsp
            of blackstrap molasses and add 1 cup water. Drink this decoction
            once a day. </LI>

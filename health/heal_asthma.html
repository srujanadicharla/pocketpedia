		<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
		<LI>Warm a ripe banana on a slow flame. Mash it and sprinkle some
            black pepper on it. Have this for instant relief. </LI>
          <LI>Mix 13 ml of fresh honey with 20ml of a paste of basil leaves
            (made by grinding basil leaves with water). Have this mixture as
            soon as you feel an attack coming.</LI>
          <LI>Sprinkle some black salt on holy basil leaves (after washing them
            thoroughly) and eat them. </LI>
          <LI>Another efficient cure for asthma would involve having roasted

          <LI>The most effective remedy for curing asthma would be to have
            finely powdered turmeric with honey. Grind turmeric, with mortar and

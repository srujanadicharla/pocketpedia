		<h3>Home Remedies for Blackheads </h3>
		<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
		<LI>An effective home remedy for blackheads would be to combine hot
            water, Epsom salt and iodine. Put 1 tsp Epsom salt and 4 drops
            iodine in 1/4 cup hot water. When the solution cools down, apply it
            on the affected area, with a cotton ball. After it dries, remove it
            with a clean cloth. </LI>
          <LI>Make a paste of fresh methi (fenugreek) leaves, with water. Apply
            the paste on the affected area for about 10 to 15 minutes. Wash off
            with warm water. Use this remedy regularly for favorable results.
          </LI>
          <LI>For removing blackheads, taking steam would be beneficial, as
            steam opens the blocked pores. After taking steam, rub the affected
            region with a towel for 1-2 minutes. Thereafter, splash it with cold
            water, closing all the open pores. </LI>
          <LI>Another effective home remedy for blackhead removal comprises of
            a face wash, made of lime juice and milk. Add 1 tbsp fresh lime
            juice to a glass of boiled milk. Use this as a face wash regularly.
          </LI>
          <LI>Make a paste of ground radish seeds, along with water. Apply the
            paste on the affected area and rinse it off with water, when it
            dries. </LI>
          <LI>Yet another effective home remedy would be to make a paste of 5
            gm red sandalwood and 5 gm turmeric, along with some milk. Apply
            this paste on the affected area and rinse off, after it dries.</LI>
          <LI>Mix almond powder with some rose water, to form a paste. Apply
            this paste on the affected area and keep it on till it dries.
            Thereafter, wash it off with warm water. </LI>
          <LI>Mix salt, lemon and honey, in equal quantities, and make a scrub.
            Yogurt can also be added to the mixture. Massage the affected area
            with this scrub for about 5 to 10 minutes. Rinse off and pat dry.
          </LI>
          <LI>Application of warm honey on the affected area, as a pack, would
            be beneficial. After the honey dries, wash the face with water.
          </LI>
          <LI>Combine equal amounts of groundnut oil and fresh lime juice.
            Apply this on the affected area and keep on for about 10 to 15
            minutes. Wash off with warm water. </LI>
          <LI>Egg white can also be used as a home remedy for blackheads. Beat
            the white portion of the egg and apply on the affected area. Wash
            off with water. While wiping the area, scrub it lightly with the
            towel.</LI>
          <LI>Mix 3 tablespoons of honey and 1 tsp of cinnamon powder in a
            bowl. Apply this on the affected area and leave overnight. Wash off
            the next morning, with lukewarm water.</LI>

		<LI>In a tsp of sesame oil, add half a clove of garlic. Heat this
            until it becomes warm. Lie on the bed and put 4 drops of it. After
            10 minutes, change the side and put the oil in the other ear. </LI>
          <LI>Warm some licorice in ghee and prepare a paste out of it. Apply
            this mixture externally over the ear. This would help you relieve of
            the pain.</LI>
          <LI>Warm some sesame oil and immerse a few leaves of the castor
            plant. Dab this oil around the ear. </LI>
          <LI>Take a piece of guggulu herb (Commiphora wightii) and burn it.
            Switch off the gas when the herb is half burned. Smoke would emit
            out of the herb. Let the smoke enter the affected area. It would
            help lessen the apin. </LI>
          <LI>Take some oil of ajwain and sesame seeds in the ratio of 1:3.
            Warm this mixture and apply it in the ear. Four drops of this would
            be effective in treating earache. </LI>
          <LI>Immerse four to five cloves of garlic in some linseed oil and
            burn it. Strain the oil and store it in a bottle. Apply this oil
            every morning and evening to get relieved from earache. </LI>
          <LI>Grind some basil leaves to form a paste. Warm this at room
            temperature. Once it becomes at a bearable temperature, put four to
            five drops of this oil in the ears. </LI>
          <LI>Take a few mango leaves and extract the juice. Warm this juice a
            little and apply it on the ear putting four drops at each ear. This
            would help cure earache. </LI>
          <LI>Chop a radish into small pieces. Immerse this into mustard oil
            and warm it. Store this oil in a glass bottle and put a few drops
            when there is pain. </LI>
          <LI>Extract some ginger juice and put a few drops of it in the ear.

          <LI>Extract the juice of the onion and warm it a little. Put four
            drops of it in each ear while going to sleep. </LI>
          <LI>Another effective home remedy would be to put four drops warmed
            mustard oil into the ears. </LI>
          <LI>If the earache is due to swimming, put few drops of mineral oil
            in each ear before going to swim. It is helpful in treating earache.
          </LI>
          <LI>If the earache is due to flying, pop in some candy or chewing
            gum. Work the throat muscle as this would relieve from the earache.
          </LI>
          <LI>Add fenugreek seed to mustard or linseed oil. Warm this oil and
            filter it. Once cooled, put it in each ear in four to five drops.
